### Synopsis

This graphing application was written in Python using Matplotlib, Numpy and PyQt5. It allows the user to select Electrocorticography data in the form of a *.mat* file. Once the file is imported, the user can select the appropriate data set and channel buttons for that data set are created dynamically. The user can then select the channels they would like to have graphed. Each channel is drawn in a different color and can be scaled along the Y-axis using the y-axis gap feild.
